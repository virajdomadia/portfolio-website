Usage
To use this code, create a new HTML file and copy and paste the code into it. Make sure to update the href attribute in the link tag to point to the location of the style.css file. Also, ensure that the src attribute in the script tag for typed.umd.js is updated to the latest version if necessary.

Add content to the "About me", "Project", and "Contact me" sections by replacing the placeholder text and images.

Dependencies
This code depends on the following external resources:

style.css: A CSS file that contains the styling for the HTML elements.
typed.js: A JavaScript library that adds a typing animation effect to the "Front-End Developer" text in the home section.
Make sure to include these resources in the same directory as the HTML file or update the href and src attributes accordingly.
